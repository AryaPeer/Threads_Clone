# Threads Clone

Welcome to Threads Clone, a feature-rich messaging platform created using the MERN stack. This project harnesses the power of technologies like MongoDB, TailwindCSS, Clerk, and webhooks to offer a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Key Highlights

- **MERN Stack:** This project utilizes the MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js stack to provide a robust and responsive application.
- **Clean + Responsive UI:** I've employed TailwindCSS to ensure an attractive and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Webhooks:** Webhooks have been integrated to facilitate real-time communication and updates within the application.
