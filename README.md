# Threads Clone

A feature-rich Threads clone using the MERN stack, incorporating technologies such as MongoDB, TailwindCSS, Clerk, and webhooks. 

Capable of supporting several concurrent users but a max of 1000 unique users can be signed up due to Clerk's free tier only allowing up to 1000 users.
